Living my dream life as programmer 🙌  
Haven't make cool stuff, yet 🤙

I care about performance and safety of my code. Along with that I started to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).  
Rust also efficient on resources, so perhaps I can contribute to [save earth](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/sustainability-with-rust/).

I started programming from 2020 using JavaScript. And in 2021 I started using TypeScript.
