# Hi there 👋

Living my dream life as programmer 🙌  
Haven't make cool stuff, yet 🤙

* 🧑‍💻 I mainly work with [JavaScript] and [TypeScript].
* 🚀 Deploy it to [AWS].
* 📖 Learning [Rust]. Use it as a hobbyist, but work would be cool.
* ⌨️ I use [NeoVim] as text editor for personal use.
* ✍️ I also write blog at [didadadida93.xyz]
